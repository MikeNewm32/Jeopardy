# Jeopardy 

### A trivia game with categories to choose from and increasingly difficult questions each assigned a dollar value between $100 and $500. Answers must be typed in as a question with proper spelling and title usage. Not doing so will result in an incorrect answer. Correct responses will add the dollar amount to your score while incorrect responses will subtract the amount. After selecting a question you must answer, trying to back out of a question will result in an incorrect response and reduction from your score.

# Future Goals

### In the future this game will be able to be played by multiple players and use modals to prompt the questions and answers. Also after adding multiple players the game will be able to declare a winner.
